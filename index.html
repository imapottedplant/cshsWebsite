        We are the Westfield High School chapter of the Computer Science Honor Society, a national organization managed by the Computer Science Teachers Association. High-achieving students in Computer Science classes are invited to join. Once inducted, they are expected to adhere to the values of Equity, Service, and Excellence. Members are also required to complete at least 10 hours of computer science-related service hours. We organize programming-related events such as Hackathons. In fact, this website was made during a Hackathon!
